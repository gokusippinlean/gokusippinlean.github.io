# 69 miles into this program, 9 weeks out from my half marathon.

I woke today at about 530am and was contemplating whether or not I should head out in the cold morning air. Eventually at a about 617am, I am standing in my driveway creeping my way into the alley one step at a time. 

I know that it is only meant to be a recovery run but I felt good and thought about what kind of pace I wanted to set for myself. I eventually settled into a nice little 10:55/mile pace for the majority of the run. 

It was cold to start, the kind of cold that all your fingertips feel like they are being stabbed with pins and needles. Often times when I am out for a run I think of all these grand ideas. Sometimes it's nothing but my brain telling me how much this fucking sucks. Today though I just felt motivated to get four miles in before my 45 minutes was up. Totally doable, just needed to keep putting one foot in front of the other. 

I tried to cut through some neighborhoods but ended up at a few dead ends a couple of times. Found myself back on I think first street? It may have been fifth I just remember cutting back into the neighbor's and realizing I wasn't far from where Rojo was at. Ran past Irvine Intermediate as well and notice all the little upgrades they got. 

I think I can get my half marathon time down to 2:15 or so. I really want to get to the 2:13 range again. The weight is kinda plateauing right now but I honestly could be eating better. I think I am gonna drink coffee a bunch again since it is an appetite suppressant.

Could probably beat Terry Fox in a race though.
