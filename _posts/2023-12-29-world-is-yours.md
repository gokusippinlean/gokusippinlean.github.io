Scarface is my favorite movie. I know it is cliche to say that as a man. And it is basically every drug dealer's one movie they can name you a scene from. Also the go to post for fighters who are about to lose. 

I particularly like when they just take a screen shot of Al Pacino and put some shit he never said over his face in some epic alpha male impact font. 

Usually something stupid like, 

# If I fuck with you I won't ask about the body just pass me a shovel

like dude c'mon you are 34 and behind on child support please get your CDL. I am not here to hate on any man but this movie attracts some really lame people to it. 

It sucks because it is such a good flick, but I do have one grievance. 

## Why the fuck did they send Tony to kill that family?

You are trying to tell me they gonna send a certified #boss to go do wet work? Are you shitting me? Why don't you send that fucker who kills Tony without flinching? That dude would do this shit no problem. Who on Earth has a bank account like Tony doing hits like that on a person who is gonna speak to the United Nations??? Where is the sense in that?

Fuck em, I don't need nobody.
