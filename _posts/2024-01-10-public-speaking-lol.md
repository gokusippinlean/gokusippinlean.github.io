I gave a small speech today introducing myself to the class. I didn't write as much as I think I should have. It went really well. Speaking in front of crowds is fun when you aren't a boring person I think. It can be weird if you aren't too into that stuff I know. But nobody really cares what you say as long as you don't say anything mean to anybody or about anyone. Like if you have a tragic story about your dog dying maybe don't tell it during a glorified icebreaker exercise you feel me. I miss my dog but you all don't gotta hear about that.

I used a Norm quote for my "hook" or whatever. I didn't even remember we had to do hooks until they mentioned it. The quote reads "There are two things which a man should scrupulously avoid: giving advice that he would not follow, and asking advice when he is determined to pursue his own opinion.‚Äù

Funny fella that guy.
