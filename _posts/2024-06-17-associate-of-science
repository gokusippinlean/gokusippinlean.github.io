I'm done with Santa Ana College. I have a 3.53 on my way out with my AS. Fuck that shit bro I am never going back. I was supposed to be in trigonometry right now. Nope. Fuck that. I am gonna keep my 3.53 and sign up for classes somewhere online at a University like WGU or UMPI and speedrun my way to a fucking bachleors in accounting. I wanna get a job as a public auditor and grind my life away for 2-3 years then go right into a Senior Accounting role at one of the big 4 firms.
I am 25 and will be 26 in less than 3 months. It's time. I am done with the traditional shit. Too old for all that bro. I am gonna apply to engineering technician jobs over the next few weeks while I grind out my bachleor's online. 

These two videos helped me do my homework this past year and just play in my room when I am not doing anything lmao. One is just SAW 85-92 from Aphex but the GT soundtrack took it's place as my room tone by week 5 of Spring semester.
