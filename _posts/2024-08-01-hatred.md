Here goes another fucking job where I leave and I know people don't like me. Does it matter in the grand scheme of things? Eh, not really. Just feels like more of the same if you ask me. I tried to make this one work but there is no way around it. Can't beat around the bush when I know the truth I don't belong at that store. I like sports and cool shit, not funko pops and anime collectibles. Some of the people there were really kind and I will not say it was all bad but Lord knows. 

I am who I am. Time to sober up and enlist in Air Force or something.
