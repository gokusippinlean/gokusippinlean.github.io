Fuck it man, I booked a night stay in San Diego tomorrow, I'm going down to the Amtrak station by 7:00 AM here in Santa Ana and I'm taking it all the way down to San Diegoâ€™s Santa Fe Depot.

My hotel is like a 10 minute walk tops from the frickin station and I'm gonna take my penny board down there and just kind of hang out in the area for the first few hours of the morning since my check in time isn't until 4:00 PM. 

Once I check in I guess I'm going to immediately go to the little section where you can you know exercise and all that. I bought tickets to go to this like rooftop cinema thing where you can basically watch movies on this like cool area that kind of has a view. Cost 35 bucks and they're showing happy Gilmore. That movie is like literally the only reason I wanted to golf. I remember buying it on VHS at a goodwill when I was like 8 or 9 because I thought Adam Sandler was funny and after that it was just always replaying and I was showing it to all my friends. 

I don't know how much I'm going to pack or how little I'm gonna pack.
