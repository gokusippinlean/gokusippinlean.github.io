I just gave my speech inside of public speaking not more than an hour and a half ago. It went well. Sometimes I think about that class and I wonder who is this for? I spoke about how public transportation can help alleviate urban congestion, and help with mental and physical health. 

I wish I was at home playing morrowind. I am getting okay at it and the mechcanics don't piss me off as much anymore. I wish the vendors had more heal potions cause I swear they are so stingy. 

Idgaf what she's doing. 

What if I try and fuck on this white girl who goes to Chapman. Would that help? I hate vapid sex. The last two people I slept with disappeared on me after. Both of them said I love you during it shit is crazy. 

There is this one catholic chick in class who I "fancy" if you wanna put it that way. She seems cool but I think to myself you are no good and you should leave that girl alone. 

I am not even a practicing Catholic enough to talk to them. I just use the Hallow app like once every two weeks and feel like I did something. 

Student store had some cool shit in it. Might use my remaining credit for something from it soon.

Country roads, take me home, to a place, I belong. West Virgina, mountain momma, take me home.
