I don't know what I want to say today really. Everton is getting smashed to bits by Cole Palmer and Chelsea to the tune of 5-0 and it is depressing. 

My job is okay I guess. I can do without some of the things I have been experiencing but that is any job right? I think I'll get to a point someday where I can laugh at the silly shit I am sweating over right now. I really do need to get a resume buffed up soon so I can start considering shopping myself around to companies as technician. 
I was thinking about the 2+2 Army contracts again but I don't know if that's truly what I need. Hoping to get a job somewhere like Oakley or something maybe. I think that would be interesting and possibly a career worthy option. Think I need to reply to those emails I ignored regarding their openings. I hope it all works out how it ought to. 

In lighter news, OCSC is top of the table baby.
