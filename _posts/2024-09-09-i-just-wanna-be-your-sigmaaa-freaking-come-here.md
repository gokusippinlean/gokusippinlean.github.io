# I feel like Pablo when I'm

I honestly don't miss being in Chemistry. I remember this time ten years ago just feeling like I wouldn't ever be a successful student inside of chemistry but here I am now. 25 years old trying to pass my first real chemistry course. 
I wrote this nasty email complaining about how frustrating the damn Aktiv service is and how stupid it felt to have to move a 0 to the other side of an equation to get it to disappear.
Don't he deserved that shit not gonna lie. I really think it's just stemming from my withdrawls due to not smoking. I feel good but I still feel like something is missing in my life right now. 
I just try and remain focus knowing it'll all regulate itself and that my body knows what's good for it. 

Thinking about Air Force again. Not because I am deseperate for insurance or anything. Maybe a little. But mostly to be a part of something bigger than myself.

We'll see. I'm a total tire kicker, so I might just change my tune in a week.
