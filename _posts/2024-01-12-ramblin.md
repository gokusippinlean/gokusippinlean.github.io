I swear to God this class is too damn long I know it is an accelerated class but I don't think we need 4 and half hours for an intro to public speaking course. Ever. Like why.

I think one the biggest things I don't like about this is the fact that this class is more meant for people who aren't confident in their own voice. I feel cool with mine.
