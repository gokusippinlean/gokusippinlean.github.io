It is one am and I am trying to post this solely for the purpose of feeling a total full closure on what I have just accomplished. I am posting to my own website I built using my own pc I built. I feel like the fucking man right now. Work hasn't even bothered me in the slightest either. I even got a bit of praise yesterday morning and I honestly cannot remember the last time I had been recognized by my boss and felt like it was sincere. I am glad to have a desktop. It's a mini ITX build and am in love with it. I am gonna try and clean up the wire management in the morning and hopefully close it up somewhat. It's all there though! In all of it's glory. Named em Philippe after my favorite achewood character. Guess it might be safe to say, 

## IDGAF WHAT SHE DOING.
