My first ever job I got during my time at Hare High School during my last quarter of my last year. I had tried to get a job before that point but no dice. I got it through my childhood friend Crisitan Luna. When I got there I found out I would also be working with my buddy Greg from elementary/middle school. I held down that job all summer before leaving and getting a job at Macy's as a signer with my buddy Andy. I worked there for maybe two months before I decided that was enough and moved onto Target for their seasonal positions. Had a small cameo at Jimmy John's for like two weeks that I literally just remembered right now LMAO. I made through that and moved onto OC Fair that summer after failing to go back to school that Spring. I worked the graveyard and was making bails upon bails of cardboard boxes. From there I was at the Islands Golf Center and I finally felt like I found a home. 

When island's golf center got bought and they let all of us go, i went to se7enleaf LLC. I was really good at this job. Even made it to supervisor buddy.

After getting hurt at jiujitsu practice, 7leaf keep calling me in anyways due to them being so short on people that it made me quit and then quitting catalyst a relationship falling apart. So now I was really alone, I got offered a place at RIF in DTSA and was happy to find a "job" but they really some fucking hoes over there LMAO. I was working a second job as a delivery driver on instacart and picking up shifts at Angels games to make money cause of how inconsistent stuff was at RIF with what they would say and what would happen.

Being angry at RIF made me go to Nike, Nike made me go back to school cause it was embarassing to tell people at work that I wasn't in school. Getting fired from Nike for "pushing" a coworker let me go get my first "real" money at Red Wing. Red Wing made me see trade money and find a goal in school.

Being in school made me find my interest in film and shit once again and pursue a bachleors. WWhile in school I just did the instacart. Actually got my taxes in from the gig I made like four bands in like three months of PT driving last semester LMAO. That plus that FATASS fasfa check was enough to more than survive. I got a bunch of sick ass gear.

Now I got a website or someshit and I am bout to working at Book-Off after pump faking Whole Foods really hard.

My commencement date is 6/7/2024.
