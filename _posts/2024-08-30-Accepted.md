Yeah man.

I got accepted to SFSU for Mechcanical Engineering for the Spring 2025 semester. I cannot believe I am saying that. I got acccepted into a four year university for a fucking STEM major bro. I fucking did it. 

San Francisco State.

I graduated from Hare and quit community college like 5 different times. 

Anthony Giovannic Ponce, got into a fucking engineering program bro. An ABET accreditted mechcanical engineering program. 

Thank you God. Thank you to my parents. Thank you to my brother. Thank you to my friends. Thank you to my professors. Thank you to all the faculty I met at SAC. Thank you to my car for never letting me miss class. Thank you Takahasai. Thank you Santa Ana College. 

I might not even leave just yet. Chances are I stay til at least next fall, but I know one thing is for sure, I fucking did something I never even though was possible. 

I think I am gonna watchn that movie Accepted starring Justin Long. I remember when I was a kid I thought that was what college was gonna be like. Now I am 25 going on 26 in about 15 days and I still haven't been on a college campus like that. Maybe it'll go something like that. Probably not, especially for my old ass but it's cool to imagine.

Hope you are all doing well. Thanks for reading. 

Go Gators.
