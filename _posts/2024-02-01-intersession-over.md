# It's over baby.

I am done with all my work for intersession. Technically, I have to turn in a self evaluation of my final speech but that is only five points and I can still get an A either way if I don't bother turning it in. I am still gonna turn it in because I'm just like that.

I really am nervous for the rest of my time here at Santa Ana College. 

I am gonna recieve my associate degree for Mechatronics. It really doesn't feel real. I use to think 4.0 GPAs were unachieveable. Now I really refuse to settle for anything less than a 4.0. I cannot believe it. If all my gradebooks are accurate, a 4.0 is locked in for this past semester meaning I can expect my GPA to climb from a 3.58 to 3.63.

I have a 3.63 GPA in college. Me.

The guy who got sent to Hare High School his last quarter of high school and had summer school every single year of it. 3.63 GPA.
