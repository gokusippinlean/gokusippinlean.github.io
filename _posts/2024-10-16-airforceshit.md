I need to get the fuck outta this house and experience someething new. I think it's time I join the Air Force. For far too long I have flip flopped on my decision and now I am a whole 4 months removed from when I had told myself I wanted to be shipping out by. 
I want to become a pilot someday this engineering shit isn't for me. I would love the idea of the GI bill covering my flight school far more than any other possiblity I currently have and I am looking for a real change in my life. I am not joining the Air Force to become a pilot. I am joining to be able to afford to become a pilot.
If they don't take me fuck it man, I'll go Army. Afterall it does stand for AirForce Rejected Me Yesterday.
