Been a big sports fan my whole life. Growing up I played football and basketball. Only ever played one year of high school basketball though. Didn't like the coach. Lately I have been really liking soccer. Football in other parts of the world. I remember when I was young my family would gamble on the week's games with their coworkers. They were these little like slips of paper the size of a business card and it would have all the games that week and you put your picks in and threw five bucks in with it. 

Sometimes I got to choose the teams.

My dad is a Chivas fan first before anything. He does root for Barcelona as well though, I believe it's only some weird stockholm syndrome with having had Messi played there. Tough loss for them today 4-1 against Real Madrid. We watched bunch of soccer together this weekend. Was nice to spend time with my dad in a meaningful way. He cuts loose when he watches futbol. It's funny but I see a lot myself in him when we watch futbol together. 

No other sport is like that. 

NBA I can't relate as much because his frame of reference of basketball is all showtime Lakers, and I don't like the Lakers. 
American football we never gotten to enjoy at all because we go for the Raiders I only ever heard stories of the old days. 
Baseball we have shared moments together but the Dodgers are so lackluster and we both hate Dave Roberts. Now with all this spending I feel nothing for the team and kinda root for the Angels more all honesty. Even if Moreno is an awful owner.

This week I saw Cruz Azul lose 1-0 to Pachuca. Chivas draw 1-1 against Santos. 

On the premier league side of things, Everton drew 0-0 against Aston Villa breaking a losing skid.

My parents both sat down and watched a Maradona documentary with me as well. I got to see the story of his doping scandal in 1994 during the USA world cup. I know my Dad was never the biggest fan of him but in the years after his death and illness he really soften up on the guy. My mom liked it because most of the interviews took place in Spanish so she was able to follow along well. My dad did let out a few "I never bought into this dude" type comments during it but he liked it. 

The Ronaldo Nazario documentary we watched for New Year's Eve he really liked. I was on the comedown of my peak from the most intense acid trip ever and I was fumbling my laptop tryna set it up in my Dad's room so we could watch it. We were using his fire stick before that point but holy shit that thing must be from like 2015 I swear to God. Anyway that documentary was awesome to see, I feel like that world cup was the capture on film more than any other world cup. 

I can't wait for OCSC to come back to town. I swear it's gonna be a fucking blast.
