What's up y'all been a minute. My laptop actually not working right about now so I have been posting way less. I am currently typing this up with my tablet using my keyboard that I didn't expect to actually connect properly. 

Enough of this unimportant bullshit. I finally ran again. Picked up program where I left off on the final workout of week 7. The next moring I got to do a light 15 minute recovery run and start up my program from 8 weeks out like nothing ever happened.

My knee has been aching a bit no gonna lie to you but I have been completely sedentary in the past month and half just focused on all the wrong things. I felt myself falling back into depression. Friday night, I was burnt the fuck out of staring at screens and was gonna go to bed. I laid down for like an hour or so then woke up feeling decent. I didn't feel like I deserve the rest. What had I even done all day? Just some gluttonous fat fuck at home. 

I made my walk to the garage and just went for it. The feeling came over me that holy shit this feels so nice. I felt like I had cheated myself out of the enjoyment I experienced in that jog. I ran the 40 minute speed run and felt so good after. 

My current weight sits at 199. I am set to run again today. Another speed run actually. Only 25 minutes this time out. I will report tomorrow with news of how it went as my rest day will be tomorrow. 8 weeks til glory. I have to complete a training program.This would the first time I ever have.

Stay hard.
