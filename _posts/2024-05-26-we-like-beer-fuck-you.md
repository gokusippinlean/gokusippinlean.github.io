I called out Wednesday Thursday and today. I have been feeling sick. Which really really pisses me off because I was feeling sick like last month at the end of the month so I am truly confused about wtf even happened there. Family is back home from Mexico, it is nice to have them around again. I cleaned the shit outta my room since I have been stuck in it all day. I should be doing my AUTOCAD assignment right now instead of dicking around on my website but I wanted to get more posts in as my semester has left me cooked from Feburary to April. At this point in the semester grades are gonna be what they are gonna be. I am salty as fuck about how my English class went at Coastline. That teacher grades freshman comp like a fucking dickhead. Just happy to finally put a fucking knife in English and now if I wanted I can just take those kinds of classes at Santa Ana now that I got 100 out the way elsewhere. 

When I was younger I kept taking English and dropping out of college. Over and over, not knowing it is three strikes then you are out. I can no longer even with my kind of GPA take English 100 at Santa Ana College. It is what it is. I just finished it at Coastline so. Fuck it. 

Also got my FASFA. Tryna save 10k by this point next year. I know I can do it baby.
