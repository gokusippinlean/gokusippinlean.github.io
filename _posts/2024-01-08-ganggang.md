Thank you Jeff Bezos, thank you Whole Foods, yesyesyes, yesyesyes, mm Ice Cream so good. Gang, gang. 

They better not make a shitshow about my spring schedule. My intersession schedule is all them so idk what else they want from me. When Feburary 12 hits if they aren't fw me I walk. Lately I been playing FO:NV again. I maxxed out science and lemme tell you, that shit is pointless bruddah. They barely have any terminals would ever have use more than fifty science which with how many programmer's dailys or whatever that +10 magazine is called, you could really just use 40 science til the end of the game, no bullshit. Lockpick is way more useful. I should've leveled that shit instead bro.
