# Man.

We just got this outline we HAVE to follow for a research speech. This shit is too easy I know it is meant to help those who are brand new to public speaking but holy shit some of this stuff you just learn in life by not being a fucking moron. 

I still haven't been contacted by Whole Foods after they extending an offer for work. I don't know if I'm gonna catch a single check off them since my real plan is to just give them my Spring schedule and tell em to work with it. I could drop out of a class or two but I CANNOT afford to miss my graduation window. 

All this is just for fucking what man like 17 an hour. My instacart driviing can give me that but they don't get me 20% off in-store. 

I have to get my run in today still. It is meant to be a hill workout but there is no chance I drive up to Peters' Canyon today, I think I will just abuse myself on the treadmill until my timer is set off. 

Do you think she's thinking about me bro?
