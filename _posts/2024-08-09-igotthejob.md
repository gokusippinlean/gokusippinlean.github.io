## BRAND NEW WHIP, GOT NO KEYS.

I got the job baby. 

Honey, dinner is on me. My favorite place is out there on the golf course. I don't give a damn what you say. It is a thinking man's game. 

Ima be taking 2 classes at SCC and 3 at SAC so I am still committed to this engineering shit. 

We ball baby.



# UPDATE: I worked this spot yesterday on the 08/12/2024 and boy howdy wtf was that. Idk if I am going back that place was a clusterfuck and if I had to bet I don't think the guy running the spot could pass a piss test. Between the casual racism/transphobic remarks and offering me drinks repeatedly throughout the shift I found myself really uncomfortable. I don't know if I am good fit for that joint. 

In better news I woke up today energized and I have been since 5:30AM or so just chilling listening to nice music and I got a hold of someone at SAC this morning. Changed my academic plan to reflect my enrollment in the Engineering program. I am just gonna fucking go for it idgaf what she's doing anymore. My new SAC projected completion date will be Spring 2026. I want to be at UCI Fall 2026. I am done with timelines. I will be an Engineer before I am 30.
