# “Perfectionism is a delusion that can rob one of a very successful, enriching life if not  careful.” John Wooden

Hello, my name is Anthony Ponce.

Today I would like to share with you something I carry with me, that is this sense of perfectionism.

Strange to say I know. I certainly don’t think I am perfect and although I know perfection is simply an idea I still chase after it. 

When I was growing up, my father used to tell me all about these old wrestlers that he had seen throughout his time growing up. Pro wrestling has some of the most memorable names I’ve ever heard; the Ultimate Warrior, Macho Man Randy Savage, and Andre the Giant. All larger than life names that spring vivid images to flair up in your mind. Out of all of these names one just seemed to simply impeccable, superb, without flaws even, that name was Mr. Perfect.

I remember hearing that name and feeling this sense of disbelief. A part of me was annoyed. How can this guy go around claiming to be perfect. The nerve of this guy, who could possibly be so smug?

Beyond this feeling of envy at his confidence, I had one simple question. Can a man even be perfect? It put a label to a feeling I always felt, this need to do the best I can. My parents instilled in me this sense of urgency to be the best I can be or else something would happen. 

It is easy to hear the phrase I am a perfectionist and think of all the positives that come from being a perfectionist. When we hear perfection we think of a hardworking and disciplined individual. A 4.0 GPA. 6 pack abs like Brad Pitt fight club.

Some of this stuff is true, and there are definitely traits that help in life from this feeling I cannot escape. It has helped me recover my academic life and put me in a positive situation in school with a great group of people I consider friends.

Unfortunately, this belief seeps into various aspects of my life, casting a shadow on relationships and making it challenging for those around me to grasp why certain things stress or bother me—things they might not deem as significant or worthy of extra concern.

At times, it fuels self-doubt, leading me to despise my own reflection and feel inadequate. Every imperfection seems like a deliberate affront.

This sense that the world is on the brink of collapse because things aren't flawless enough can be paralyzing. It becomes a barrier to taking action in areas of life that I genuinely want to pursue. The constant demand for everything to align perfectly before I can proceed becomes an obstacle, hindering progress. It's as if I've set up a series of prerequisites, believing that without them, success is unattainable. 

What happens when you don't strive for perfection? Well nothing really. The sky doesn't fall. But you set yourself back. Starting over again is difficult because you just think things like if it was meant to be it would've happened already. You're just not perfect enough in this life. All these silly ideas to convince yourself to not even try. I think quitting is harder than trying for this reason.

Breaking free from this mindset is an ongoing challenge, but I recognize the importance of dismantling these barriers to live a more fulfilling and liberated life.

In recent years, I've embarked on a journey to transform this mindset into something more positive. I've embraced the idea of accepting things as they are, not implying a tolerance for complacency, but rather recognizing that giving our best effort is our own version of perfection. By striving to be our best selves each day, we attain a sense of perfection in that moment, acknowledging that progress and effort are key components of personal growth. At this very moment, everything is precisely as it should be, and therein lies its perfection.

## "The height of perfection is mediocrity." – Pitigrilli

This quote invites us to reconsider our traditional notions of perfection. It suggests that true perfection may not lie in an idealized state but rather in embracing the authenticity found in the ordinary and the everyday. Perhaps, in recognizing the beauty of simplicity and acknowledging the imperfect nature of life, we discover a profound sense of perfection that transcends conventional standards.

I believe every single one of you here is perfect in their very own way. Thank you for your time, you've all been the perfect audience.
