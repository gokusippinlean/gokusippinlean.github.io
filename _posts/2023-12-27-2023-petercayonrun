Running in Peters Canyon Park was miserable. To start, for some reason, I was the person to lead the group of us at the beginning. They probably thought, "He’s taking it easy enough that I can warm up with this guy," but the problem is, their warm-up is kind of my, let's say, 10K pace. Because of this, after half a mile, I was kind of winded since I hadn’t warmed up yet. The rest of the run, I lost sight of them between all the hills. It was for the best because I could focus on my own pace and keep my own tempo. Those hills are disgustingly brutal. I’ve been making good progress on the treadmill, but it makes me realize how much more difficult running outside is with a gross incline. I ran 3.5 miles and I had enough. Stay hard or whatever.
