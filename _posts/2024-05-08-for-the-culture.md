Somehow by the grace of god I have 3 Bs and one A going into these last few weeks of the semester. I need to maintain both at this level to be able to recieve my degree on time. My PC has been going strong and is doing well. I also watched OCSC get knocked out of the US Open Cup last night and it was pretty heartbreaking. Nakkim got stopped on his PK that could have equalized and I feel for him. He is the captain and just got back from injury like two games ago. Everyone misses PKs eventually but he missed his during a big moment and it can affect a player for weeks mentally if they aren't all there. Still happy he is on the field again. I am supposed to be working on my outline for my final essay for the ENGL 100 class I am taking at Coastline. Hoping I can get that done before tonight's machining class. 

# Man, I started watching the Real-Bayern game instead and got nothing done.

I cannot believe Madrid won that shit last second that way, insane.

Alright now I GOTTA start my English hw fr.
