Alright so making my last build in that lil ass case was a mistake cuz it was only like a week before shit was shorted and I cooked a MTX and CPU in the process. I was able to exchange like all that shit back to amazon and just got the new parts at micro center. The case I picked up off amazon and honestly I knew I it was gonna be fine as long as my components worked out okay. I did lose that cpu I had brought over from my last build but I upgraded in the process so I cannot really feel too bad my total cost came out to be $485 so I can say I still spent under 500 thankfully. Cheers to that bro.
