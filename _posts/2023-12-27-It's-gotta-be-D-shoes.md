When I was in middle school my favorite player in the world was Derrick Rose. I used to pick the Chicago Bulls on 2k growing up and honestly was a fan of Ben Gordon first. It wasn't until my brother told me who Derrick Rose was that I began to pay attention more. Ben Gordon had an amazing playoff series verus the Celtics that I will never forget but the years to come blew any expections I had out of the water and I was convinced I was watching a once in a lifetime player. Being like any kid who played basketball growing up I would want the best shoes to play the best. Others wanted Kobes or KDs, I was a weirdo and wanted adizero Rose 1s. I saved up for weeks. Watched all the youtube ads as well. Fast don't lie was a joke amongst the friends I played pick up with. I eventually got to the store and the colorway I wanted was sold out in my size. Because of this I would end up purchasing a pair of the newly released 1.5s in black with the white toe. I was so juiced. I put them on and immmediately ran to my backyard and set up chairs to do dribbling drills alone all damn day. I was in love I felt fast. I thought I was D Rose. The amount of ill advised reverse layups I was taking was absurd and should've got me my ass beat. 

## Fast don't lie baby.
