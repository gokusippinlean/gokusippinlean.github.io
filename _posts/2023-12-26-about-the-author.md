My name is Anthony, I am a mechatronics engineering student who really just wants to be a film student. Been into collecting cards of all kinds for years just don't ask me about Magic the Gathering or Pokemon, I am more a Yu-gi-oh kind of guy. Sometimes I do location sound for people's projects. I'm kinda nice at Doom (2016), Hotline Miami, and Payday 2 lowkey.  I like to listen to music like Sade, Aphex Twin and The Cure. If you are reading this, I love you. Check out [my twitter/x](https://twitter.com/gokusippinlean) for live action shit posting and a chance to send me a DM telling me I am annoying or need therapy.
