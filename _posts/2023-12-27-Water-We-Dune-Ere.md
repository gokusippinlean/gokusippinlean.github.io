# Fractured Clavicle and a bum knee that I never figured out 
That's what brazilian jiu-jitsu gave me. I will not let it stop me. I don't have a single fucking stripe and I am still a white belt. So what. I had 3 Fs and 8/9 Ws when I went back to school. Now I have a fucking 3.5 weighted across all my courses and am set to get my Associate's this coming summer. It isn't about where you are at right now. It is where you can go right now.
