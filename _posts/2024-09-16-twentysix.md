Life's a bitch and then you die. That's why we puff loud cause you never know when you're gonna go.

Yeah life's a bitch and then you die.

10 days into sobering up. 

I hate it all.

My birthday came and went this Friday. Nobody really said much save a few people. My dad ain't even say shit to me. Matter of fact he hasn't said shit to me since that Thursday. I want to just fast forward to the good parts. I am barely hanging onto all A's in my classes and my Pre-Calc/Trig class just started so I am pretty intimidated by the idea of it.

This is getting tough man.

Also why the fuck she block me a year after not speaking with each other? I thought we were in love bbygirl. Ahhhh just playing still was weird seeing my following go down one and then putting the math together. Weird timing.
